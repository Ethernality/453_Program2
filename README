# 453_Program2

Program 2 to Implement a user-level threading library for Linux. This threading system—called Lightweight Processes (LWPs)—that runs multiple execution contexts (“threads”) inside one real OS process. This will be done so by implementing nine required functions such as lwp_create, lwp_yield, lwp_exit, lwp_wait, lwp_start, etc., to manage thread creation, scheduling, context switching, and cleanup.
